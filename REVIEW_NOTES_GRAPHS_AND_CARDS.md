**Detailed Changes & Rationale:**

**1. Comparison Chart Enhancements (Recharts - `app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   **Rounded Bar Corners:** Bar charts now have slightly rounded corners for a softer, more modern look. (Initially attempted with gradient fills which broke charts, reverted to solid fills).
    *   **Subtler Grid Lines:** Grid lines in charts are made less prominent.
    *   **Custom Tooltip:**
        *   Implemented a `CustomTooltip` component to style chart tooltips with a dark background (`bg-dashGreen-darker`) and Dashcoin branding colors, replacing the default white.
        *   Added `cursor={false}` to the Recharts `<Tooltip>` component in bar charts to remove the default white background highlight on the chart bars themselves when hovering, allowing the custom tooltip to be the primary focus.
    *   **Dynamic Bar Colors:**
        *   Market Cap Comparison: Token 1 bar is green if its market cap is >= Token 2's, red otherwise. Token 2 bar is the opposite.
        *   Holders Comparison: Similar logic applied for holder counts.
        *   Colors used: `GREEN_COLOR = "#10B981"`, `RED_COLOR = "#EF4444"`.
    *   **Y-Axis Label Formatting & Margin:**
        *   Added `tickFormatter={formatNumber}` to Y-axes of bar charts to display large numbers in a more readable format (e.g., "1.2M", "500K").
        *   Increased left margin for charts (`left: 50`) to prevent Y-axis labels from being cut off.
    *   **Stat Boxes Below Charts:** Updated text labels in the small stat boxes below the Market Cap and Holders charts to dynamically use the actual token names (e.g., "[Token1 Name] Market Cap").

**2. Autocomplete Dropdown for Token Search (Re-implementation & Styling - `app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   **Re-implementation:** The token search autocomplete dropdown functionality (previously on `nicho/frontend-updates` and reverted during graph work) was re-added.
        *   Includes state variables for suggestions (`token1Suggestions`, `token2Suggestions`) and visibility (`showToken1Suggestions`, `showToken2Suggestions`).
        *   `handleTokenSearch` filters `allTokens` (currently `dummyAllTokens`) based on user input.
        *   `handleSuggestionClick` populates the input field when a suggestion is clicked.
        *   `useEffect` with `dummyAllTokens` for local testing as `/api/tokens` is not fully functional locally.
        *   Refs (`token1SuggestionsRef`, `token2SuggestionsRef`) and an event listener are used to handle clicks outside the dropdown to close it.
    *   **Styling:**
        *   The dropdown background is now `bg-dashYellow`.
        *   Dropdown item text is `text-dashBlack`.
        *   Hover effect on items: `hover:bg-yellow-500`, `hover:text-white`.

**3. "Enter" Key for Comparison Submission (`app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   The token input section (Token 1, Token 2, Compare button) is now wrapped in a `<form>` element.
    *   An `onSubmit` handler is added to the form, which calls `e.preventDefault()` and then `handleCompare()`.
    *   The "Compare" button's `type` attribute is set to `"submit"`.
    *   This allows users to press the "Enter" key in either token input field to trigger the comparison.

**4. Military-Themed `GrowthStatCard` (`components/ui/growth-stat-card.tsx` & `app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   **Component Creation (`components/ui/growth-stat-card.tsx`):**
        *   A new reusable component `GrowthStatCard` was created with a distinct military/tactical theme.
        *   Includes:
            *   Background with tactical grid and scanning line effects.
            *   Corner tactical markers.
            *   Dashed stencil border.
            *   Main value display (e.g., `+$X.XXM / DAY`).
            *   Label text with blinking indicator lights.
        *   **Conditional "Winner" Styling:**
            *   Accepts an `isWinner` prop.
            *   If `isWinner` is true:
                *   Displays `Target`, `TrendingUp`, and `Zap` icons.
                *   Applies `animate-tactical-pulse` to the main value.
                *   Shows 3 "bullet hole" effects, randomly positioned in the outer 20% of the card (to avoid overlaying central text).
            *   If `isWinner` is false, these elements/animations are not rendered or are made invisible while still occupying space (for height consistency).
    *   **Integration (`app/compare/page.tsx`):**
        *   Two `GrowthStatCard` instances are displayed below the Market Cap and Holders comparison charts, one for each token.
        *   Data for the cards (market cap growth per day) is pulled from `comparisonData.token1.marketcapgrowthperday` and `comparisonData.token2.marketcapgrowthperday`.
        *   **Layout & Sizing:**
            *   Cards are placed directly below their respective chart columns.
            *   Made full-width of their parent column (by removing `max-w-md` and `mx-auto`).
            *   The card representing the token with higher `marketcapgrowthperday` is scaled up (`scale-150`).
            *   The winning card also receives `breathing-border` and `breathing-shadow` classes for extra emphasis (defined in `app/globals.css`).
            *   **Height Consistency Fix:** Logic in `GrowthStatCard` was adjusted to ensure the icon container always renders (using `invisible` class if not a winner) to maintain consistent base height before scaling.
    *   **Label Text Refinement:**
        *   The `value` prop displays the formatted daily growth (e.g., `+$12.37M / day`).
        *   The `label` prop displays: `[Coin Name] has added +$[Number] in marketcap per day since creation.`
    *   **CSS Animations (`app/globals.css`):** Added keyframes and classes for `breathing-border`, `breathing-shadow`, `tactical-pulse`, `tactical-flash`, `tactical-scan`, `tactical-blink`, and `appear`.

**5. "Reverse Comparison" Feature (`app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   The previous static right arrow between token headers has been replaced with a clickable `ArrowLeftRight` icon (from `lucide-react`).
    *   A `handleReverseCompare` function was implemented:
        *   Swaps `comparisonData.token1` and `comparisonData.token2`.
        *   Swaps the `token1Name` and `token2Name` state variables, which updates the input fields.
    *   This allows users to quickly flip the positions of the compared tokens.

**6. Text Centering & UI Polish (`app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   The main page title ("TOKEN COMPARISON") and its subheader are now centered.
    *   The "Enter Token Names to Compare" card title is centered.
    *   The "Token 1 Name" and "Token 2 Name" labels above the input fields are centered.

**7. "Detailed Comparison" Table Enhancements (`app/compare/page.tsx`)**
    *   **"24h Volume" Label Change:** Changed to "Total Volume" for potentially broader interpretation if data source changes.
    *   **"Difference" Column Rework:**
        *   Instead of a percentage or absolute difference, this column now shows a multiple (e.g., "2.5x", "<0.1x", "N/A").
        *   **`calculateMultiple` Helper Function:**
            *   Computes `value1 / value2`.
            *   Rounds up to one decimal place (e.g., 2.41x becomes 2.5x).
            *   Handles division by zero (returns "N/A").
            *   Handles cases where `value1` is zero (returns "0.0x").
            *   If the actual multiple is less than 0.1 (e.g., 0.07x), it displays "<0.1x".
        *   **`getDifferenceColorClass` Helper Function:**
            *   Colors the multiple text:
                *   Green (`text-green-500`) if `value1 > value2` (multiple > 1.0x).
                *   Red (`text-red-500`) if `value1 < value2` (multiple < 1.0x, excluding "<0.1x").
                *   Neutral (`opacity-70`) if `value1 === value2` (multiple is "1.0x"), or if multiple is "N/A", "0.0x", or "<0.1x".
    *   **Launch Date Difference:** Displays the absolute difference in days between launch dates.
    *   **MarketCap Growth/Day Metric:** Added to the table with the same multiple and color-coding logic for its difference.

**Files Modified:**
*   `app/compare/page.tsx` (Primary logic, UI structure, chart configurations, GrowthStatCard integration, table updates, autocomplete, reverse compare)
*   `components/ui/growth-stat-card.tsx` (New component for military-themed stat cards, conditional rendering, animations, height consistency fix)
*   `app/globals.css` (Added CSS animations: `breathing-border`, `breathing-shadow`, `tactical-pulse`, `tactical-flash`, `tactical-scan`, `tactical-blink`, `appear`. Removed `overflow: hidden` from `.card-with-border` for dropdown visibility - *Note: This class might need review if it affects other cards*).

**Testing Notes & QA Focus:**

*   **Token Comparison Flow:**
    *   Test searching for tokens using the autocomplete (both name and symbol). Verify dropdown appearance (`bg-dashYellow`, `text-dashBlack`, hover styles) and functionality.
    *   Verify "Enter" key submission from both input fields.
    *   Verify the "Compare" button functionality.
    *   Test with various token pairs from `dummyAllTokens` (e.g., Dashcoin vs Solana, USDC vs JUP).
    *   Verify error handling if one or both tokens are not found.
*   **Chart Visuals & Data:**
    *   Check Market Cap and Holders charts for correct data display.
    *   Verify dynamic bar colors (green for higher, red for lower) are accurate for both charts.
    *   Hover over bars: Ensure custom tooltip appears with correct styling and data. Ensure no default white highlight on bars.
    *   Check Y-axis labels for correct formatting (K, M, B) and ensure they are not cut off.
    *   Verify stat boxes below charts show correct token names and values.
*   **GrowthStatCard Functionality & Appearance:**
    *   Verify one card is displayed for each token below its respective chart column.
    *   Confirm the `value` (e.g., `+$X.XXM / day`) and `label` text are correct for each token.
    *   **Winner Logic:** The card with the higher `marketcapgrowthperday` should:
        *   Be scaled 150% larger (`scale-150`).
        *   Have `breathing-border` and `breathing-shadow` animations.
        *   Display `Target`, `TrendingUp`, and `Zap` icons.
        *   Have the `animate-tactical-pulse` on its value.
        *   Show 3 bullet holes.
    *   The non-winning card should NOT have these winner-specific styles/icons/animations.
    *   **Crucially, verify both cards have the same base height when neither or both are scaled (e.g., if growth values are equal or before comparison).** The `scale-150` should apply to an already equal-height card.
    *   Check all visual elements of the `GrowthStatCard` (background, borders, corner markers, blinking lights).
*   **"Reverse Comparison" Feature:**
    *   Click the `ArrowLeftRight` icon between token headers.
    *   Verify token data, names in headers, and input field values swap correctly.
    *   Verify all charts and `GrowthStatCard`s update to reflect the swapped data.
*   **Detailed Comparison Table:**
    *   Verify all metrics display correct values for each token.
    *   **Difference Column:**
        *   Check calculation of multiples for Market Cap, Holders, Total Volume, and MarketCap Growth/Day. Pay attention to:
            *   Rounding (e.g., 2.41x -> 2.5x).
            *   `value1 / 0` -> "N/A".
            *   `0 / value2` (where value2 !=0) -> "0.0x".
            *   `value1 / value2` < 0.1 -> "<0.1x".
        *   Check color-coding of the multiple based on `getDifferenceColorClass` logic.
    *   Verify Launch Date difference is shown in days.
*   **UI & Responsiveness:**
    *   Check text centering for page title, card titles, and input labels.
    *   View on different screen sizes to ensure layout remains acceptable.
*   **Console Errors:** Open browser developer tools and check for any console errors or warnings during interaction.
